A command-line tool for discovering and validating exposed API keys on GitHub. This lite version focuses on educational and security awareness purposes.

## Lite Version Limits

| Feature | Lite (This Repo) | Full Version |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| Search Provider | GitHub only | GitHub, GitLab, SourceGraph |
| API Providers | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google | 15+ providers |
| Valid Key Cap | 50 keys | Higher limits |
| Interface | CLI | Web UI + API |
| Database | SQLite (local) | PostgreSQL |

## ⚠️ Educational Purpose Only

This tool is for **educational and security awareness purposes only**.

- **Learn** how API keys get exposed in public repositories
- **Understand** the importance of secret management
- **Report** exposed keys responsibly to repository owners
- **Never** use discovered keys for unauthorized access

**Do NOT publish your database or results publicly.** This would expose working API keys to malicious actors.

## Quick Start

### 1. Download

Download the latest release for your platform from [**Releases**](https://github.com/TSCarterJr/UnsecuredAPIKeys-OpenSource/releases):

| Platform | File |
|----------|------|
| Windows | `unsecuredapikeys-win-x64.exe` |
| Linux | `unsecuredapikeys-linux-x64` |

**No .NET runtime required** - these are self-contained executables.

### 2. Run

**Windows:**
```bash
.\unsecuredapikeys-win-x64.exe
```

**Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x unsecuredapikeys-linux-x64
./unsecuredapikeys-linux-x64
```

### 3. Configure GitHub Token

On first run, go to **Configure Settings** > **Set GitHub Token**.

Create a token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Required scope: `public_repo`

### 4. Start Searching

- **Start Scraper**: Searches GitHub for exposed API keys (runs continuously)
- **Start Verifier**: Maintains up to 50 valid keys (re-checks as needed)
- **View Status**: Shows current statistics
- **Export Keys**: Export to JSON or CSV

### Building from Source (Optional)

If you prefer to build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TSCarterJr/UnsecuredAPIKeys-OpenSource.git
cd UnsecuredAPIKeys-OpenSource
dotnet build
cd UnsecuredAPIKeys.CLI
dotnet run
```

## How It Works

### Scraper
1. Uses your GitHub token to search for common API key patterns
2. Extracts potential keys using regex patterns for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google
3. Stores discovered keys in a local SQLite database

### Verifier
1. Validates discovered keys against the actual provider APIs
2. Maintains exactly 50 valid keys (lite limit)
3. Re-checks existing valid keys periodically
4. When a key becomes invalid, verifies new ones until back to 50

## Prerequisites

- **.NET 10 SDK** - [Download here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)
- **GitHub Personal Access Token** - [Create here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
- **Platform**: Windows, macOS, or Linux

## Supported Providers (Lite)

| Provider | Pattern Examples |
|----------|------------------|
| OpenAI | `sk-proj-*`, `sk-or-v1-*` |
| Anthropic | `sk-ant-api*` |
| Google AI | `AIzaSy*` |

## Configuration

Copy `appsettings.example.json` to `appsettings.json` and configure:

```json
{
  "GitHub": {
    "Token": "ghp_YOUR_TOKEN"
  },
  "Database": {
    "Path": "unsecuredapikeys.db"
  }
}
```

Or configure directly via the CLI menu.

## Database

The SQLite database (`unsecuredapikeys.db`) is auto-created on first run in the working directory.

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Location** | Same folder as the executable |
| **Reset** | Delete `unsecuredapikeys.db` and restart |
| **Backup** | Copy the `.db` file |
| **View data** | Use any SQLite browser (e.g., DB Browser for SQLite) |

## Search Queries

On first run, default search queries are automatically seeded:

- `sk-proj-`, `sk-or-v1-`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` (OpenAI)
- `sk-ant-api`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (Anthropic)
- `AIzaSy`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (Google)

The scraper rotates through these queries automatically.

## Rate Limiting

Built-in delays prevent API abuse:

| Operation | Delay |
|-----------|-------|
| Between searches | 5 seconds |
| Between verifications | 1 second |
| Batch size | 10 keys |

GitHub's API allows ~30 searches/minute with authentication.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "No GitHub token configured" | Go to Configure Settings > Set GitHub Token |
| "Rate limit exceeded" | Wait 60 seconds, or use a different token |
| Build fails | Ensure .NET 10 SDK is installed: `dotnet --version` |
| No keys found | Check your token has `public_repo` scope |
| Database locked | Close other apps using the .db file |
